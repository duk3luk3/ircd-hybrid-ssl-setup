ircd-hybrid + stunnel for debian
================================

1. SSL Key and Certificates

- if you want to use a self-signed CA for test purposes,
  * Just run the script, it will generate everything correctly
- if you have a CA but no certificate, place
  * The CA certificate as ca/ca-root.pem
  * The script will generate a server key and certificate signing request
  * Get the cert signed and place it as key/ircd-cert.pem
- if you already have a CA and a CA-signed certificate, place
  * The CA certificate as ca/ca-root.pem
  * The server certificate as key/ircd-cert.pem
  * The server key as key/ircd.key

Note that issuer and subject cannot be the same, i.e. the identification data
in CA and cert must be different, or openssl will always give a "self-signed cert"
verification error.
tl;dr give the certificate a CN that's different from the CA
